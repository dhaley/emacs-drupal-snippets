/**
 * ${2:Perform redirect validation before a redirect is created or updated.
 *
 * This hook is invoked from redirect_validate(), after a user has has finished
 * editing the redirect and is submitting it. It is invoked at the end of all
 * the standard validation steps.
 *
 * To indicate a validation error, use form_set_error().
 *
 * Note: Changes made to the $redirect object within your hook implementation
 * will have no effect. The preferred method to change a redirect's content is
 * to use hook_redirect_presave() instead. If it is really necessary to change
 * the redirect at the validate stage, you can use form_set_value().
 *}
 * @param $redirect
 *   The redirect being validated.
 * @param $form
