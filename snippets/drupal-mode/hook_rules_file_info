 * ${2:Specify files containing rules integration code.

 * All files specified in that hook will be included when rules looks for
 * existing callbacks for any plugin. Rules remembers which callback is found in
 * which file and automatically includes the right file before it is executing
 * a plugin method callback. The file yourmodule.rules.inc is added by default
 * and need not be specified here.
 * This allows you to add new include files only containing functions serving as
 * plugin method callbacks in any file without having to care about file
 * inclusion.

 *   An array of file names without the file ending which defaults to '.inc'.
