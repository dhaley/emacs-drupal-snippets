/**
 * ${2:Define rules conditions.
 *
 * This hook is required in order to add a new rules condition. It should be
 * placed into the file MODULENAME.rules.inc, which gets automatically included
 * when the hook is invoked.
 *
 * Adding conditions works exactly the same way as adding actions, with the
 * exception that conditions can't provide variables and cannot save parameters.
 * Thus the 'provides' attribute is not supported. Furthermore the condition
 * implementation callback has to return a boolean value.
