/**
 * ${2:Alter a menu router item right after it has been retrieved from the database or cache.
 *
 * This hook is invoked by menu_get_item() and allows for run-time alteration of router
 * information (page_callback, title, and so on) before it is translated and checked for
 * access. The passed-in $router_item is statically cached for the current request, so this
 * hook is only invoked once for any router item that is retrieved via menu_get_item().
 *
 * Usually, modules will only want to inspect the router item and conditionally
 * perform other actions (such as preparing a state for the current request).
 * Note that this hook is invoked for any router item that is retrieved by
 * menu_get_item(), which may or may not be called on the path itself, so implementations
 * should check the $path parameter if the alteration should fire for the current request
 * only.
 *}
 * @param $router_item
 *   The menu router item for $path.
 * @param $path
 *   The originally passed path, for which $router_item is responsible.
 * @param $original_map
 *   The path argument map, as contained in $path.
 *
 * @see menu_get_item()
