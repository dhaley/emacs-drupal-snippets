/**
 * ${2:Declare provided rules data processors.
 *
 * The hook implementation should be placed into the file MODULENAME.rules.inc,
 * which gets automatically included when the hook is invoked.
 * For implementing a data processors a class has to be provided which
 * extends the abstract RulesDataProcessor class. Therefore the abstract
 * method process() has to be implemented, but also the methods form() and
 * access() could be overridden in order to provide a configuration form or
 * to control access permissions.
 *}
 * @return
 *   An array of information about the module's provided data processors. The
 *   array contains a sub-array for each processor, with the processor name as
 *   the key. The name may only contain lower case alpha-numeric characters and
 *   underscores and should be prefixed with the providing module name, whereas
 *   'select' is reserved as well.
 *   Possible attributes for each sub-array are:
 *   - class: The implementation class, which has to extend the
 *     RulesDataProcessor class. Required.
 *   - weight: A weight for controlling the processing order of multiple data
 *     processors. Required.
 *   - type: Optionally, the data types for which the data processor should be
 *     used. Defaults to 'text'. Multiple data types may be specified using an
 *     array.
