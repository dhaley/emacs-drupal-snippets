/**
 * ${2:Act on taxonomy terms when loaded.
 *
 * Modules implementing this hook can act on the term objects returned by
 * taxonomy_term_load_multiple().
 *
 * For performance reasons, information to be added to term objects should be
 * loaded in a single query for all terms where possible.
 *
 * Since terms are stored and retrieved from cache during a page request, avoid
 * altering properties provided by the {taxonomy_term_data} table, since this
 * may affect the way results are loaded from cache in subsequent calls.
 *}
 * @param $terms
 *   An array of term objects, indexed by tid.
