/**
 * ${2:Register information about FileTransfer classes provided by a module.
 *
 * The FileTransfer class allows transferring files over a specific type of
 * connection. Core provides classes for FTP and SSH. Contributed modules are
 * free to extend the FileTransfer base class to add other connection types,
 * and if these classes are registered via hook_filetransfer_info(), those
 * connection types will be available to site administrators using the Update
 * manager when they are redirected to the authorize.php script to authorize
 * the file operations.
 *}
 * @return array
 *   Nested array of information about FileTransfer classes. Each key is a
 *   FileTransfer type (not human readable, used for form elements and
 *   variable names, etc), and the values are subarrays that define properties
 *   of that type. The keys in each subarray are:
 *   - 'title': Required. The human-readable name of the connection type.
 *   - 'class': Required. The name of the FileTransfer class. The constructor
 *     will always be passed the full path to the root of the site that should
 *     be used to restrict where file transfer operations can occur (the $jail)
 *     and an array of settings values returned by the settings form.
 *   - 'file': Required. The include file containing the FileTransfer class.
 *     This should be a separate .inc file, not just the .module file, so that
 *     the minimum possible code is loaded when authorize.php is running.
 *   - 'file path': Optional. The directory (relative to the Drupal root)
 *     where the include file lives. If not defined, defaults to the base
 *     directory of the module implementing the hook.
 *   - 'weight': Optional. Integer weight used for sorting connection types on
 *     the authorize.php form.
