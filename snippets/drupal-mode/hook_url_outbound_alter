/**
 * ${2:Alters outbound URLs.
 *}
 * @param $path
 *   The outbound path to alter, not adjusted for path aliases yet. It won't be
 *   adjusted for path aliases until all modules are finished altering it, thus
 *   being consistent with hook_url_inbound_alter(), which adjusts for all path
 *   aliases before allowing modules to alter it. This may have been altered by
 *   other modules before this one.
 * @param $options
 *   A set of URL options for the URL so elements such as a fragment or a query
 *   string can be added to the URL.
 * @param $original_path
 *   The original path, before being altered by any modules.
 *
 * @see url()
