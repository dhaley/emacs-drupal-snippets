/**
 * ${2:Perform cleanup tasks.
 *
 * This hook is run at the end of each page request. It is often used for
 * page logging and specialized cleanup. This hook MUST NOT print anything.
 *
 * Only use this hook if your code must run even for cached page views.
 * If you have code which must run once on all non-cached pages, use
 * hook_init() instead. That is the usual case. If you implement this hook
 * and see an error like 'Call to undefined function', it is likely that
 * you are depending on the presence of a module which has not been loaded yet.
 * It is not loaded because Drupal is still in bootstrap mode.
 *}
 * @param $destination
 *   If this hook is invoked as part of a drupal_goto() call, then this argument
 *   will be a fully-qualified URL that is the destination of the redirect.
