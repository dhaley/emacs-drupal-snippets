 * 'tips callback' in hook_filter_info(), with this recommended callback
 * name pattern. It is called from _filter_tips().
 *
 * A filter's tips should be informative and to the point. Short tips are
 * preferably one-liners.
 *}
 * @param $filter
 *   An object representing the filter.
 * @param $format
 *   An object representing the text format the filter is contained in.
 * @param $long
 *   Whether this callback should return a short tip to display in a form
 *   (FALSE), or whether a more elaborate filter tips should be returned for
 *   theme_filter_tips() (TRUE).
 *
 * @return
 *   Translated text to display as a tip.
