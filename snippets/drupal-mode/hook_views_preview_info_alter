 * ${2:This hook should be placed in MODULENAME.views.inc and it will be auto-loaded.
 * MODULENAME.views.inc must be in the directory specified by the 'path' key
 * returned by MODULENAME_views_api(), or the same directory as the .module
 * file, if 'path' is unspecified.
 *
 * Alter the rows that appear with a view preview, which include query and
 * performance statistics. $rows is an associative array with two keys:
 * - query: An array of rows suitable for theme('table'), containing information
 *   about the query and the display title and path.
 * - statistics: An array of rows suitable for theme('table'), containing
 *   performance statistics.
 *
 * Warning: $view is not a reference in PHP4 and cannot be modified here. But it IS
 * a reference in PHP5, and can be modified. Please be careful with it.
