/**
 * ${2:Define the API version of Skinr your code is compatible with.
 *
 * This is required when creating a new Skinr plugin. It checks to make sure
 * your Skins are compatible with the installed version of Skinr and takes care
 * of loading the include files.
 *}
 * @return
 *   An associative array describing Skinr API integration:
 *   - directory: (optional) The name of a sub-directory, in which include files
 *     containing skin or group definitions may be found.
 *   - path: (optional) The path to the directory containing the directory
 *     specified in 'directory'. Defaults to the path of the module or theme
 *     implementing the hook.
 *   In case no Skinr plugin include files exist for your implementation, simply
 *   define the function with an empty function body.
 *
 * The "hook" prefix is substituted with the name of the module or theme that
 * implements it, e.g. THEME_skinr_api_VERSION() in template.php, or
 * MODULE_skinr_api_VERSION() in MODULE.module.
 *
 * VERSION is normally identical to Skinr's major version; e.g., "2".
