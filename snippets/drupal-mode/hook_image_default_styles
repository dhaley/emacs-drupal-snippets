/**
 * ${2:Provide module-based image styles for reuse throughout Drupal.
 *
 * This hook allows your module to provide image styles. This may be useful if
 * you require images to fit within exact dimensions. Note that you should
 * attempt to re-use the default styles provided by Image module whenever
 * possible, rather than creating image styles that are specific to your module.
 * Image provides the styles "thumbnail", "medium", and "large".
 *
 * You may use this hook to more easily manage your site's changes by moving
 * existing image styles from the database to a custom module. Note however that
 * moving image styles to code instead storing them in the database has a
 * negligible effect on performance, since custom image styles are loaded
 * from the database all at once. Even if all styles are pulled from modules,
 * Image module will still perform the same queries to check the database for
 * any custom styles.
 *}
 * @return
 *   An array of image styles, keyed by the style name.
 * @see image_image_default_styles()
