/**
 * ${2:Declare archivers to the system.
 *
 * An archiver is a class that is able to package and unpackage one or more files
 * into a single possibly compressed file.  Common examples of such files are
 * zip files and tar.gz files.  All archiver classes must implement
 * ArchiverInterface.
 *
 * Each entry should be keyed on a unique value, and specify three
 * additional keys:
 * - class: The name of the PHP class for this archiver.
 * - extensions: An array of file extensions that this archiver supports.
 * - weight: This optional key specifies the weight of this archiver.
 *   When mapping file extensions to archivers, the first archiver by
 *   weight found that supports the requested extension will be used.
