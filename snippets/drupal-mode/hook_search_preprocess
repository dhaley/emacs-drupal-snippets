/**
 * ${2:Preprocess text for search.
 *
 * This hook is called to preprocess both the text added to the search index and
 * the keywords users have submitted for searching.
 *
 * Possible uses:
 * - Adding spaces between words of Chinese or Japanese text.
 * - Stemming words down to their root words to allow matches between, for
 *   instance, walk, walked, walking, and walks in searching.
 * - Expanding abbreviations and acronymns that occur in text.
 *}
 * @param $text
 *   The text to preprocess. This is a single piece of plain text extracted
 *   from between two HTML tags or from the search query. It will not contain
 *   any HTML entities or HTML tags.
 *
 * @return
 *   The text after preprocessing. Note that if your module decides not to alter
 *   the text, it should return the original text. Also, after preprocessing,
 *   words in the text should be separated by a space.
 *
