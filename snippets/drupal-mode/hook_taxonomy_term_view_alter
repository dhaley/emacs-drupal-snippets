/**
 * ${2:Alter the results of taxonomy_term_view().
 *
 * This hook is called after the content has been assembled in a structured
 * array and may be used for doing processing which requires that the complete
 * taxonomy term content structure has been built.
 *
 * If the module wishes to act on the rendered HTML of the term rather than the
 * structured content array, it may use this hook to add a #post_render
 * callback. Alternatively, it could also implement
 * hook_preprocess_taxonomy_term(). See drupal_render() and theme()
 * documentation respectively for details.
 *}
 * @param $build
 *   A renderable array representing the node content.
