 * The discovery function callbacks will be called in turn with an unique
 * parameter, the claimed identifier. They have to return an associative array
 * with array of services and claimed identifier in the same form as returned by
 * openid_discover(). The resulting array must contain following keys:
 *   - 'services' (required) an array of discovered services (including OpenID
 *   version, endpoint URI, etc).
 *   - 'claimed_id' (optional) new claimed identifer, found by following HTTP
 *   redirects during the services discovery.
 *
 * The first discovery method that succeed (return at least one services) will
 * stop the discovery process.
 *}
 * @return
 *   An associative array which keys are the name of the discovery methods and
 *   values are function callbacks.
