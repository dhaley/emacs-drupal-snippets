/**
 * ${2:D6 to D7 upgrade procedure hook for mapping action or condition names.
 *
 * If for a module the action or condition name changed since Drupal 6, this
 * "hook" can be implemented in order to map to the new name of the action or
 * condition.
 *
 * This is no real hook, but a callback that is invoked for each Drupal 6
 * action or condition that is to be upgraded to Drupal 7. E.g. the function
 * name called for the action "rules_action_set_node_title" would be
 * "rules_action_set_node_title_upgrade_map_name".
 *}
 * @param $element
 *   The element array of a configured condition or action which is to be
 *   upgraded.
 * @return
 *   The name of the action or condition which should be used.
