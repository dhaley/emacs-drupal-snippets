 * ${2:Define image toolkits provided by this module.

 * The file which includes each toolkit's functions must be declared as part of
 * the files array in the module .info file so that the registry will find and
 * parse it.
 *
 * The toolkit's functions must be named image_toolkitname_operation().
 * where the operation may be:
 *   - 'load': Required. See image_gd_load() for usage.
 *   - 'save': Required. See image_gd_save() for usage.
 *   - 'settings': Optional. See image_gd_settings() for usage.
 *   - 'resize': Optional. See image_gd_resize() for usage.
 *   - 'rotate': Optional. See image_gd_rotate() for usage.
 *   - 'crop': Optional. See image_gd_crop() for usage.
 *   - 'desaturate': Optional. See image_gd_desaturate() for usage.
 *}
 * @return
 *   An array with the toolkit name as keys and sub-arrays with these keys:
 *     - 'title': A string with the toolkit's title.
 *     - 'available': A Boolean value to indicate that the toolkit is operating
 *       properly, e.g. all required libraries exist.
