/**
 * ${2:Forces delta mapping of a facet block.
 *
 * This obscure hook is useful for cases where facets are disabled, but their
 * block positioning needs to be set anyways. If a facet is enabled via the
 * facetapi_set_facet_enabled() API function, its block needs to be enabled
 * and assigned to a region despite the facet not being enabled in the Facet API
 * interface, which would normally prevent the block from being listed.
 *}
 * @return array
 *   An associative array keyed by searcher. Each sub array is an associative
 *   array keyed by realm name to facet names whose delta mappings are forced.
