/**
 * ${2:Perform node validation before a node is created or updated.
 *
 * This hook is invoked from node_validate(), after a user has has finished
 * editing the node and is previewing or submitting it. It is invoked at the
 * end of all the standard validation steps, and after the type-specific
 * hook_validate() is invoked.
 *
 * To indicate a validation error, use form_set_error().
 *
 * Note: Changes made to the $node object within your hook implementation will
 * have no effect.  The preferred method to change a node's content is to use
 * hook_node_presave() instead. If it is really necessary to change
 * the node at the validate stage, you can use form_set_value().
 *}
 * @param $node
 *   The node being validated.
 * @param $form
 *   The form being used to edit the node.
 * @param $form_state
 *   The form state array.
