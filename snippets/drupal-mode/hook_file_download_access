/**
 * ${2:Control download access to files.
 *
 * The hook is typically implemented to limit access based on the entity the
 * file is referenced, e.g., only users with access to a node should be allowed
 * to download files attached to that node.
 *}
 * @param array $file_item
 *   The array of information about the file to check access for.
 * @param $entity_type
 *   The type of $entity; for example, 'node' or 'user'.
 * @param $entity
 *   The $entity to which $file is referenced.
 *
 * @return
 *   TRUE is access should be allowed by this entity or FALSE if denied. Note
 *   that denial may be overridden by another entity controller, making this
 *   grant permissive rather than restrictive.
 *
 * @see hook_field_access().
