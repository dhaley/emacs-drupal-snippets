/**
 * ${2:Alter the list of projects before fetching data and comparing versions.
 *
 * Most modules will never need to implement this hook. It is for advanced
 * interaction with the update status module: mere mortals need not apply.
 * The primary use-case for this hook is to add projects to the list, for
 * example, to provide update status data on disabled modules and themes. A
 * contributed module might want to hide projects from the list, for example,
 * if there is a site-specific module that doesn't have any official releases,
 * that module could remove itself from this list to avoid "No available
 * releases found" warnings on the available updates report. In rare cases, a
 * module might want to alter the data associated with a project already in
 * the list.
 *}
 * @param $projects
 *   Reference to an array of the projects installed on the system. This
 *   includes all the metadata documented in the comments below for each
 *   project (either module or theme) that is currently enabled. The array is
 *   initially populated inside update_get_projects() with the help of
 *   _update_process_info_list(), so look there for examples of how to
 *   populate the array with real values.
 *
 * @see update_get_projects()
 * @see _update_process_info_list()
