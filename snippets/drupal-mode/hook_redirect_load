/**
 * ${2:Act on redirects being loaded from the database.
 *
 * This hook is invoked during redirect loading, which is handled by
 * entity_load(), via classes RedirectController and
 * DrupalDefaultEntityController. After the redirect information is read from
 * the database or the entity cache, hook_entity_load() is invoked on all
 * implementing modules, and then hook_redirect_load() is invoked on all
 * implementing modules.
 *
 * This hook should only be used to add information that is not in the redirect
 * table, not to replace information that is in that table (which could
 * interfere with the entity cache). For performance reasons, information for
 * all available redirects should be loaded in a single query where possible.
 *
 * The $types parameter allows for your module to have an early return (for
 * efficiency) if your module only supports certain redirect types.
 *}
 * @param $redirects
 *   An array of the redirects being loaded, keyed by rid.
 * @param $types
 *   An array containing the types of the redirects.
