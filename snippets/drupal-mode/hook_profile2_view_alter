/**
* Alter the results of entity_view() for profiles.
*
* @param $build
*   A renderable array representing the profile content.
*
* This hook is called after the content has been assembled in a structured
* array and may be used for doing processing which requires that the complete
* profile content structure has been built.
*
* If the module wishes to act on the rendered HTML of the profile rather than
* the structured content array, it may use this hook to add a #post_render
* callback. Alternatively, it could also implement hook_preprocess_profile2().
* See drupal_render() and theme() documentation respectively for details.
*
* @see hook_entity_view_alter()
