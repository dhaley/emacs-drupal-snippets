 * ${2:The full documentation for this hook is now in the advanced help.
 *
 * This hook should be placed in MODULENAME.views.inc and it will be auto-loaded.
 * MODULENAME.views.inc must be in the directory specified by the 'path' key
 * returned by MODULENAME_views_api(), or the same directory as the .module
 * file, if 'path' is unspecified.
 *
 * This is a stub list as a reminder that this needs to be doc'd and is not used
 * in views anywhere so might not be remembered when this is formally documented:
 * - style: 'even empty'}
