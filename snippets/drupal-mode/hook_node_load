/**
 * ${2:Act on nodes being loaded from the database.
 *
 * This hook is invoked during node loading, which is handled by entity_load(),
 * via classes NodeController and DrupalDefaultEntityController. After the node
 * information is read from the database or the entity cache, hook_load() is
 * invoked on the node's content type module, then field_attach_node_revision()
 * or field_attach_load() is called, then hook_entity_load() is invoked on all
 * implementing modules, and finally hook_node_load() is invoked on all
 * implementing modules.
 *
 * This hook should only be used to add information that is not in the node or
 * node revisions table, not to replace information that is in these tables
 * (which could interfere with the entity cache). For performance reasons,
 * information for all available nodes should be loaded in a single query where
 * possible.
 *
 * The $types parameter allows for your module to have an early return (for
 * efficiency) if your module only supports certain node types. However, if your
 * module defines a content type, you can use hook_load() to respond to loading
 * of just that content type.
 *}
 * @param $nodes
 *   An array of the nodes being loaded, keyed by nid.
 * @param $types
 *   An array containing the types of the nodes.
 *
 * For a detailed usage example, see nodeapi_example.module.
