/**
 * ${2:Act on a node after validated form values have been copied to it.
 *
 * This hook is invoked when a node form is submitted with either the "Save" or
 * "Preview" button, after form values have been copied to the form state's node
 * object, but before the node is saved or previewed. It is a chance for modules
 * to adjust the node's properties from what they are simply after a copy from
 * $form_state['values']. This hook is intended for adjusting non-field-related
 * properties. See hook_field_attach_submit() for customizing field-related
 * properties.
 *}
 * @param $node
 *   The node object being updated in response to a form submission.
 * @param $form
 *   The form being used to edit the node.
 * @param $form_state
 *   The form state array.
