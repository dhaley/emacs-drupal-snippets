/**
 * ${2:Define components to Webform.
 *}
 * @return
 *   An array of components, keyed by machine name. Required properties are
 *   "label" and "description". The "features" array defines which capabilities
 *   the component has, such as being displayed in e-mails or csv downloads.
 *   A component like "markup" for example would not show in these locations.
 *   The possible features of a component include:
 *
 *     - csv
 *     - email
 *     - email_address
 *     - email_name
 *     - required
 *     - conditional
 *     - spam_analysis
 *     - group
 *
 *   Note that most of these features do not indicate the default state, but 
 *   determine if the component can have this property at all. Setting
 *   "required" to TRUE does not mean that a component's fields will always be 
 *   required, but instead give the option to the administrator to choose the
 *   requiredness. See the example implementation for details on how these
 *   features may be set.
 *
 *   An optional "file" may be specified to be loaded when the component is
 *   needed. A set of callbacks will be established based on the name of the
 *   component. All components follow the pattern:
 *
 *   _webform_[callback]_[component]
 *
 *   Where [component] is the name of the key of the component and [callback] is
 *   any of the following:
 *
 *     - defaults
 *     - edit
 *     - render
 *     - display
 *     - submit
 *     - delete
 *     - help
 *     - theme
 *     - analysis
 *     - table
 *     - csv_headers
 *     - csv_data
 *
 * See the sample component implementation for details on each one of these
 * callbacks.
 *
