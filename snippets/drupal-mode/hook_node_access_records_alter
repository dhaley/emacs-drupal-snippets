/**
 * ${2:Alter permissions for a node before it is written to the database.
 *
 * Node access modules establish rules for user access to content. Node access
 * records are stored in the {node_access} table and define which permissions
 * are required to access a node. This hook is invoked after node access modules
 * returned their requirements via hook_node_access_records(); doing so allows
 * modules to modify the $grants array by reference before it is stored, so
 * custom or advanced business logic can be applied.
 *}
 * @see hook_node_access_records()
 *
 * Upon viewing, editing or deleting a node, hook_node_grants() builds a
 * permissions array that is compared against the stored access records. The
 * user must have one or more matching permissions in order to complete the
 * requested operation.
 *
 * A module may deny all access to a node by setting $grants to an empty array.
 *
 * @see hook_node_grants()
 * @see hook_node_grants_alter()
 *
 * @param $grants
 *   The $grants array returned by hook_node_access_records().
 * @param $node
 *   The node for which the grants were acquired.
 *
 * The preferred use of this hook is in a module that bridges multiple node
 * access modules with a configurable behavior, as shown in the example with the
 * 'is_preview' field.
 *
