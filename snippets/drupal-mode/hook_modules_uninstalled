/**
 * ${2:Perform necessary actions after modules are uninstalled.
 *
 * This function differs from hook_uninstall() in that it gives all other
 * modules a chance to perform actions when a module is uninstalled, whereas
 * hook_uninstall() is only called on the module actually being uninstalled.
 *
 * It is recommended that you implement this hook if your module stores
 * data that may have been set by other modules.
 *}
 * @param $modules
 *   An array of the modules that were uninstalled.
