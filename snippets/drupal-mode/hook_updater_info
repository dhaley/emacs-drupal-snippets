/**
 * ${2:Provide information on Updaters (classes that can update Drupal).
 *
 * An Updater is a class that knows how to update various parts of the Drupal
 * file system, for example to update modules that have newer releases, or to
 * install a new theme.
 *}
 * @return
 *   An associative array of information about the updater(s) being provided.
 *   This array is keyed by a unique identifier for each updater, and the
 *   values are subarrays that can contain the following keys:
 *   - class: The name of the PHP class which implements this updater.
 *   - name: Human-readable name of this updater.
 *   - weight: Controls what order the Updater classes are consulted to decide
 *     which one should handle a given task. When an update task is being run,
 *     the system will loop through all the Updater classes defined in this
 *     registry in weight order and let each class respond to the task and
 *     decide if each Updater wants to handle the task. In general, this
 *     doesn't matter, but if you need to override an existing Updater, make
 *     sure your Updater has a lighter weight so that it comes first.
