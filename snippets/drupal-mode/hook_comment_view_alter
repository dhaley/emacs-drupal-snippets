/**
 * ${2:The comment was built; the module may modify the structured content.
 *
 * This hook is called after the content has been assembled in a structured array
 * and may be used for doing processing which requires that the complete comment
 * content structure has been built.
 *
 * If the module wishes to act on the rendered HTML of the comment rather than the
 * structured content array, it may use this hook to add a #post_render callback.
 * Alternatively, it could also implement hook_preprocess_comment(). See
 * drupal_render() and theme() documentation respectively for details.
 *}
 * @param $build
 *   A renderable array representing the comment.
