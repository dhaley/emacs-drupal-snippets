/**
 * ${2:Act on field_attach_load().
 *
 * This hook is invoked after the field module has performed the operation.
 *
 * Unlike other field_attach hooks, this hook accounts for 'multiple loads'.
 * Instead of the usual $entity parameter, it accepts an array of entities,
 * indexed by entity ID. For performance reasons, information for all available
 * entities should be loaded in a single query where possible.
 *
 * The changes made to the entities' field values get cached by the field cache
 * for subsequent loads.
 *
 * See field_attach_load() for details and arguments.}
