/**
 * ${2:Define all searchers provided by the module.
 *
 * Searchers are synonymous with search pages, or environments. Each searcher is
 * associated with an adapter instance. Multiple searchers can share the same
 * adapter class, but each searcher will spawn a separate instance of the
 * adapter. Each searcher must be unique, so it is common practice to prefix the
 * name with the module implementing the hook, such as "apachesolr@searcher-1",
 * "apachesolr@searcher-2", "search_api@searcher-1", etc.
 *}
 * @return array
 *   An associative array keyed by unique name of the searcher. Each searcher is
 *   an associative array containing:
 *   - label: The human readable name of the searcher displayed in the admin UI.
 *   - adapter: The adapter plugin ID associated with the searcher.
 *   - url processor: (optional) The URL processor plugin ID associated with the
 *     searcher. Defaults to "standard".
 *   - types: (optional) An array containing the types of content indexed by the
 *     searcher. A type is usually an entity such as 'node', but it can contain
 *     non-entities as well. Defaults to array('node').
 *   - path: (optional) The MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK item which the admin UI page
 *     is added to as a MENU_LOCAL_TASK. An empty string if the backend manages
 *     the admin UI menu items internally. Defaults to an empty string meaning
 *     the backend is responsible for adding the admin UI menu items.
 *   - supports facet missing: (optional) TRUE if the searcher supports
 *     "missing" facets. Defaults to FALSE.
 *   - supports facet mincount: (optional) TRUE if the searcher supports the
 *     minimum facet count setting. Defaults to FALSE.
 *   - include default facets: (optional) TRUE if the searcher should include
 *     the facets defined in facetapi_facetapi_facet_info() when indexing node
 *     content, FALSE if they should be skipped.
